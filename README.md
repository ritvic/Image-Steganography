# Image-Steganography

Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within
another file, message, image, or video. Steganography is more discreet than
cryptography when we want to send secret information. On the other hand, the
hidden message is easier to extract.


# Conclusion
Steganography is not intended to replace cryptography but rather to supplement it. If
a message is encrypted and hidden with a steganographic method it provides an
additional layer of protection and reduces the chance of the hidden message being
detected.
Steganography goes well beyond simply hiding text information in an image.
Steganography applies not only to digital images but to other media as well, such as
audio files, communication channels, and other text and binary files.
